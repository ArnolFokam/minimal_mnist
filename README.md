# MinimalMNIST
A (literally) minimal implementation of a CNN for MNIST classification

This repo is a toy example of how to train a CNN for MNIST classification. The `main.py` file contains the minimal code to train a feedforward neural network for MNIST classification. The `solution.py` file contains the code to train a CNN for MNIST classification.

## Running the code

```bash
uv run main
```

```bash
uv run solution
```
